    "Quick Verification:\n",
    "    \n",

    "Creating Formulas Efficiently:\n",
    "    \n",
    "While AutoSum is primarily used for adding up numbers, it can also be a helpful starting point for creating more complex formulas. Once the SUM function is inserted, you can modify the formula as needed to perform other calculations or include additional functions.\n",

    "Consistency Across Sheets:\n",
    "    \n",
    "When working with multiple sheets or workbooks containing similar data layouts, using AutoSum ensures consistency in how totals are calculated across different areas."
