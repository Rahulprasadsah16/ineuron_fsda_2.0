    "In Excel, a \"cell\" refers to a single rectangular box or unit within a worksheet where you can enter data, perform calculations, or display information. Each cell is identified by a unique combination of its column letter and row number. For example, the cell in the first column and first row is referred to as cell \"A1,\" the cell in the second column and third row is referred to as cell \"B3,\" and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can contain various types of data, including numbers, text, dates, formulas, and functions. Users can manipulate the content of cells by entering data directly, copying and pasting, or using Excel's built-in functions and formulas to perform calculations and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can also be formatted in different ways to change their appearance, such as adjusting the font, size, color, alignment, and applying borders or cell shading. Excel provides a flexible and powerful platform for organizing, analyzing, and presenting data using these cells within worksheets.\n"

    "Using Formulas in Tables:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Excel tables (also known as Excel lists) are structured ranges of data that expand automatically when new data is added. When using formulas within a table, relative references are typically used so that the formulas adjust dynamically as the table size changes.\n",

    "    \n",
    "If you're creating a pattern or series of calculations in Excel, relative references can be used to maintain the pattern as you copy the formulas across rows or columns.\n",

    "    \n",
    "When building templates or models where formulas need to be flexible and adjust based on the context of the data, relative references are often used to ensure that the formulas behave as expected when copied or moved.\n"
