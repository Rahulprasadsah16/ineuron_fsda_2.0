    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow you to break down a program into smaller, manageable chunks of code.\n",
    "You can define a function to perform a specific task, and then reuse that function whenever you need to perform that task again.\n",
    "This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing you to focus on the functionality of a specific task without worrying about the implementation details.\n",
    "By encapsulating code within functions, you can hide the implementation details and expose only the interface, making the code easier to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Organization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions improve the readability and organization of code by breaking it into logical units.\n",
    "Well-named functions serve as documentation, providing meaningful names that describe what the function does.\n",
    "Functions help to structure the code, making it easier to navigate and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Maintainability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions make it easier to update and maintain code.\n",
    "If you need to make a change to a specific functionality, you only need to update the code within the corresponding function, rather than searching through the entire program.\n",
    "This makes code maintenance less error-prone and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be reused in different parts of a program or even in different programs altogether.\n",
    "Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times from different parts of the program, promoting code reusability and saving development time."
