    "The main benefits of using lambda expressions in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to define small, one-line functions without the need for a full def statement. This can lead to more concise and readable code, especially when you're working with higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability: In some cases, using a lambda expression can make the code more readable, especially when the function being defined is simple and the lambda expression is used directly where it's needed, without assigning it to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Lambda expressions are commonly used in functional programming paradigms, where functions are treated as first-class citizens. They allow for the creation of anonymous functions, which can be passed around as arguments to other functions, making it easier to write functional-style code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Unnecessary Name Creation: When a function is only needed in one place and won't be reused, defining it with a lambda expression instead of giving it a name with a def statement can avoid cluttering the namespace with unnecessary function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convenience: Using lambda expressions can sometimes be more convenient than defining a named function, especially for simple tasks like mapping or filtering elements in a list."

    "Function Length and Complexity:\n",

    "Keep functions short and focused on a single task or responsibility (often referred to as the \"Single Responsibility Principle\").\n",
    "Aim for functions that can be easily understood at a glance, typically not exceeding a few dozen lines of code.\n",
    "Refactor large or complex functions into smaller, more manageable units to improve readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit the number of parameters passed to a function, ideally keeping it to a small, manageable number (often referred to as the \"Parameter Count Principle\").\n",
    "Prefer passing parameters explicitly rather than relying on global variables or mutable state.\n",
    "Consider using default parameter values or keyword arguments for optional parameters to enhance flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide clear and concise documentation (docstrings) for each function, describing its purpose, behavior, parameters, return value, and any exceptions it may raise.\n",
    "Follow a consistent documentation style, such as the Google Style Python Docstrings or the reStructuredText format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle errors and edge cases gracefully within functions, using appropriate error handling mechanisms like try-except blocks or conditional statements.\n",
    "Raise informative exceptions with descriptive error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Purity and Side Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for functions that are \"pure\" (i.e., produce the same output for the same input without modifying external state) whenever possible.\n",
    "Minimize side effects (e.g., modifying global variables, performing I/O operations) within functions to improve predictability and testability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function Composition and Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design functions to be modular and reusable, encapsulating common functionality that can be easily composed and combined with other functions.\n",
    "Favor composing functions from smaller, specialized units rather than duplicating code or implementing complex logic within a single function.\n",

    "Testing and Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write comprehensive unit tests for functions to ensure they behave as expected under different scenarios and edge cases.\n",
