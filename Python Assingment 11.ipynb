    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() for displaying messages in several scenarios due to the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Configurability: Logging provides a more flexible and configurable way to manage output messages. You can easily adjust the logging level to control the verbosity of messages emitted, allowing you to filter out less important messages in production environments without modifying the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Severity levels: Logging allows you to categorize messages based on their severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), providing a structured approach to logging that helps in identifying and prioritizing issues. This makes it easier to debug and troubleshoot applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output destinations: Logging messages can be directed to multiple output destinations simultaneously, such as the console, files, email, or external services. This flexibility allows you to store logs in different formats and locations, making it easier to analyze and monitor application behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamps and formatting: Logging provides built-in support for adding timestamps and custom formatting to log messages, which can be useful for analyzing log data and correlating events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Logging provides better error handling capabilities compared to print(). You can define custom log handlers to handle different types of errors and exceptions, allowing you to centralize error reporting and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: In some cases, logging can offer better performance compared to print(), especially when logging to files or external services, as it allows you to optimize logging behavior and manage resources more efficiently."
